# GAMEUP
A simple button bashing game using primarily front-end technology.

#### Description
A simple button bashing game, where only the highest scorer gets there name on the leaderboard. Build with HTML, CSS, & Javascript. 

Currently the game works well on android devices. You can use all your fingers all the same time to tap the screen. With iOS devices especially the iPhone 6s it is very difficult to get high scores and accurate touch register due to the 3D Touch technology.

#### Future features
- Graphics background
- animation
- seperate page for all player scores
